# 3D Printer Model: DB9-Shell

- Designed for ~5mm cable.
- Designed for M2.5 (countersunk) screw and nut (or possibly the DB standard #4-40).
- Might need to grind around the holes on the back of the DB9 shell for a better fit (see below).
- Might need to countersink the holes on the front of the DB9 shell for a better fit (see below).
